# CodeIgniter 4 Sample Forum Application

This repo is a playground to explore creating a forum application using CodeIgniter 4. I've tried to keep the structure as simple and as close to the default as possible. This is not intended to be a production-ready application, but rather a learning tool.

No guarantee is made that this repo represents a complete, working application. It is a work in progress.
